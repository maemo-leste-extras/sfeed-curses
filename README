sfeed_curses
------------

sfeed_curses is a curses UI front-end for sfeed.

It shows the TAB-separated feed items in a graphical command-line UI. The
interface has a look inspired by the mutt mail client. It has a sidebar panel
for the feeds, a panel with a listing of the items and a small statusbar for
the selected item/url. Some functions like searching and scrolling are
integrated in the interface itself.


Build and install
-----------------

$ make
# make install


Usage
-----

Like the format programs included in sfeed you can run it like this:

	sfeed_curses ~/.sfeed/feeds/*

... or by reading from stdin:

	sfeed_curses < ~/.sfeed/feeds/xkcd

By default sfeed_curses marks the items of the last day as new/bold. To manage
read/unread items in a different way a plain-text file with a list of the read
urls can be used. To enable this behaviour the path to this file can be
specified by setting the environment variable $SFEED_URL_FILE to the url file:

	SFEED_URL_FILE=~/.sfeed/urls sfeed_curses ~/.sfeed/feeds/*

There is an shellscript "sfeed_markread" to process the read and unread items.
See the man page for more detailed information.
