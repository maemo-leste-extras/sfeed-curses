.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
formats feed data (TSV) from
.Xr sfeed 1
from stdin or
.Ar file
into a UI.
If one or more
.Ar file
are specified, the basename of the
.Ar file
is used as the feed name in the output.
It will also show a sidebar with the feeds.
If no
.Ar file
parameters are specified and so the data is read from stdin the feed name
is empty.
There will be no sidebar visible by default when reading from stdin.
.Pp
Items with a timestamp from the last day compared to the system time at the
time of formatting are marked as new.
.Pp
.Nm
aligns the output.
Make sure the environment variable
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is set to a UTF-8 locale, so it can determine the proper column-width
per rune, using
.Xr mbtowc 3
and
.Xr wcwidth 3 .
